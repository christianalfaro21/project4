			You may have noticed that most of the favorited movies above were made by Disney. This is for a good reason. Disney is one of the biggest animation studios in the world and has produced many movies with the first one being all the way back in 1937, which most of you might know was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Disney's most recent movie's have been released in 2017 and 2018.
